# REQUIRED for CurseForge packager (non-obvious):
# The LEFT side MUST be <repo-folder>/<addon-folder>
#   - <addon-folder> MUST be the folder that contains the .toc files
# The RIGHT side MUST be the addon name:
#   - Must match the .toc filename (AddonName.toc)
#   - Must match `package-as`
#
# NOTE:
# CurseForge release.sh (poorly) relies on `move-folders` for *addon discovery*,
# not just post-processing. If this does not exactly match
# <repo>/<addon>, `toc_root_paths` will be empty and packaging WILL fail.
#
# ⚠️ Do not change unless you also change the repo/addon layout.
